# Tenacity
This is an open-source project dedicated to developing the Tenacity mod client.
## Roadmap
We are currently working on recoding the base functionality from Tenacity in order to make it more sleek and fit the open-source type of code we are looking for, which is sleek, modular and easy to understand. Once the base functionality module system and ui has been added, we will start working on porting the modules from Tenacity(Legacy) to Tenacity(Modern). Then we will follow the old roadmap from Legacy Tenacity, which includes adding different types of ui for users, a beautiful and easy to use library for making ui with modules.
## What's next
After having the base Tenacity in here and built, fully undetected and completely working bug free. We hope to add more people on to the team allowing us to also make a Gorilla Tag Launcher/Mod Manager to easily browse and install mods along with having full alt support, easily switching alt accounts and seeing which is banned before even launching the game.
